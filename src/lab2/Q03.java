/*
Define a class named Book with the following member variables:
• bookId (an integer representing the unique ID of the book)
• price (a double representing the price of the book)
• quantity (an integer representing the quantity of books purchased)
Additionally, include a static variable totalAmount to keep track of the total amount spent on all books.
The class should have:
• A parameterized constructor to initialize the bookId, price, and quantity. Note: Use “this”.
• A displayDetails() method to print the details of the book (i.e., bookId, price, quantity).
• A method to calculate and return the total cost for that book (price * quantity).
• Update the static variable totalAmount to include the total cost of the book purchased.
Now, write a separate Main class to simulate the purchasing of 5 different books. Display the details of each
book, and finally, display the total amount spent on the purchase of all books.
